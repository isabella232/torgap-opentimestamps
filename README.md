# Blockchain Commons `torgap-opentimestamps`

### by Christopher Allen and Gorazd Kovacic

Run [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/) as a Tor onion service. 

## Additional Information

* [StackScript](StackScript/torgap-opentimestamps.sh) — Installation StackScript for Linode
* [http://3xcaaswwserqnox56z7d7wifwyxm2jsdv4fniffym5jwncqx3qr7uzid.onion/](http://3xcaaswwserqnox56z7d7wifwyxm2jsdv4fniffym5jwncqx3qr7uzid.onion/) — Example Deployment

## Status - Late Alpha

`torgap-opentimestamps`  is currently under active development and in the late alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

### Roadmap

The StackScript may implement installing a private Calendar server in future.

## Installation Instructions

You can install `torgap-opentimestamps` on a [Linode](https://cloud.linode.com) Debian server with a [StackScript](StackScript/torgap-opentimestamps.sh).

The StackScript allows you to choose to install Bitcoin Core to perform verification of timestamps. Otherwise, the verification
is delegated to a public Esplora explorer. 

You can also choose to timestamp files with publicly available Calendar servers and upgrade the incomplete timestamps.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.
